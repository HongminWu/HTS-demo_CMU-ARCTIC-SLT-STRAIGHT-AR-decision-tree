Steps to make a working copy:

- run autoconf to generate configure

- run configure with appropriate params

- add appropriate symlinks for data/raw and data/utts

- make stuff in exec.darcs executable by running something like:
	cat exec.darcs | grep -v '^$' | while read file; do chmod u+x $file; done

Then make any other adjustments, run make, and wait!
