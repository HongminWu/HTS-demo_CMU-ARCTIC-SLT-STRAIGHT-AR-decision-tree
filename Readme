Steps to make a working copy:

1. copy boring.darcs into _darcs/prefs/boring
2. run autoconf to generate configure
3. run configure with appropriate params
4. add appropriate symlinks for data/raw and data/utts
5. make appropriate things executable:
    - scripts/*.pl
    - scripts/<bash scripts>
    - testgen/gensyn*

Then make any other adjustments, run make, and wait!
