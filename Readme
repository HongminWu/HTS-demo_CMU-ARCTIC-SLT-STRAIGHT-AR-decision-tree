Steps to make a working copy:

- run autoconf to generate configure

- run configure with appropriate params

- add appropriate symlinks for data/raw and data/utts

- make appropriate things executable:

	- scripts/*.pl

	- scripts/<bash scripts>

	- testgen/gensyn*

Then make any other adjustments, run make, and wait!
